# Big Tech Hearing
A project analyzing quantitative statistics from the house judiciary committee's Big Tech hearing in July 2020

I undertook this project after watching the hearing, having made some anecdotal conclusions and wanting to see how the numbers came out. 
Firstly, I noticed that the house representatives rarely gave the CEOs time to speak, and wanted to see how the data on numbers of words 
spoken by the two groups compared. Secondly, I noticed that there seemed to be many cases where the representatives used large percentages
to describe the big tech companies especially in regards to market share, to which the CEOs seemed to often respond with smaller percentages 
that painted their companies in a differnt light. To test these hypotheses, I downloaded the transcripts of the hearing and analyzed the 
text in a jupyter notebook.
